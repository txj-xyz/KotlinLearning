    Lesson 60: Unit Testing
        NOTES:
        - Practice of creating a test for a function
        - Unit = Describes a small piece of code usually a function that is tested separately
        - Kotlin stdlib `Kotlin.test` includes unit testing
        - Wrappers for assert included
        - Small isolated test classes for expected behaviour
        - Gradual development of complicated software, but remaining functionality
        - Helps keep stable code
        - We need to create a test class when we make a test file
        - We must annotate a test function with `@Test`
        - We use `assert..()` for testing cases in our functions, there are many different types
        - Pressing `Option + Enter` on a class allows us to generate tests
